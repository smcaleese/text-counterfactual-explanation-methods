"On a dark, gloomy new year's eve night, an ill nurse, her life slowly ebbing away, demands that david holm be presented to her at once. We don't yet know who david holm is, or why this nurse wishes to see him, but her only dying wish is to speak with him just one more time. On the other side of the town, nestled comfortably amongst the gravestones of the local cemetery, holm ( victor sjostrom, who also directed ) and two of his drunken associates merrily await the coming of the new year. "" here we can tell just when to drink the new year in, "" exclaims holm, casting a finger towards the large clock tower that looms through the darkness. Little does he know, however, that he will not be alive to greet it. To pass the time, holm cheerfully recites a ghost story. He'd once had a friend name george, "" a merry fellow "" who was "" smarter than the rest of us. "" on one new year's eve several years ago, george has broken up a potentially disastrous brawl, fearing that the final man to draw his last breath before midnight would be condemned to drive the phantom chariot for the next year, doing death's bidding and collecting the souls of the deceased. "" and, gentlemen, george died last new year's eve! "" concludes holm happily, not bothering to contain his mocking skepticism of the man's beliefs. As fate has it, of course, an unexpected violent encounter results in holm's death, just on the stroke of midnight. As the man's transparent spirit rises gingerly from his earthly body, he witnesses, to his horror, the distant approach of a phantom carriage. The driver, a frail cloaked figure-a sickle clasped tightly in his hand-steps down from the carriage and approaches. We are astonished to discover that the driver is none other than a decrepit george, preparing to pass on his ghastly duty to this year's successor. Considering the era in which'korkarlen'is made, the special effects in this film are absolutely superb. Cinematographer julius jaenzon used double-exposure photography to create the eerie, ghostly silhouette of the carriage and its damned driver. Even today, the end result is highly effective. A particularly impressive scene involves the phantom chariot travelling to the ocean floor to retrieve the soul of a drowned man.

"Haines is excellent as the brash cadet who thinks west point will really amount to something now that he has arrived. Haines displays his easy, goofy comic persona as he takes on west point and joan crawford, the local beauty. Great fun for the first half. And amazingly touching after haines's character goes too far and nearly gets shunned by fellow cadets. The new, humility-filled haines get s alast-minute reprieve to play in the bill football game against navy and, despite a broken arm, wins the game. Great, rousing entertainment by mgm in this haines formula film, shows billy at his best. William bakewell also scores as the skinny follower. The handsome-but-goony character would be played by clark gable, cary grant, gary cooper and others in later decades, another take on the beautiful-but-daffy dames played by carole lombard and marion davies.

"This movie states through its protagonist that the world is essentially sadness and pain and those that ignore this have blinders on. One can argue whether this is true or not. But even if you accept this as true, the movie's ending either a ) disputes this by saying there can be some good in tragic situations or b ) forgets this and uses a cliched montage in order to leave the audience feeling uplifted. That the movie metaphorically acquits its protagonist by presenting him as a sympathetic character despite any evidence for that sympathy shows contempt for the supporting characters who were the most compelling in the film. So what you have in this film is a script that is not consistent in its theme and direction that does not bring the ending into sync with the rest of the film. There are excellent performances given by every member of the cast especially spacey, olin, martin donovan, and ann magnuson.

"Just saw this movie on opening night. I read some other user comments which convinced me to go see it... I must say, I was not impressed. I'm so unimpressed that I feel the need to write this comment to spare some of you people some money. First of all "" the messengers "" is very predictable, and just not much of a thriller. It might be scary for someone under 13, but it really did nothing for me. The climax was laughable and most of the audience left before the movie's resolution.

"This episode so far is the best of the series. The story was told perfectly. I especially liked how the writers made it a desmond episode ; it was his best performance to date and he definitely deserved the emmy for his performance. We had some of our questions answered in this episode, but since the show is called lost we know there will be more questions brought up too. First the answered : walt is reunited finally with his father michael, second, michael's betrayal is exposed to jack, sawyer, kate, and hurly and because of this betrayal kate, jack, and sawyer are all taken captive by the others. This was a great way to end the show. On the other side of the island we see locke going through a mental breakdown with the button. This leads to another answered question about how the plane really went down. However there are some unanswered questions : first, what happened to locke, eko, and desmond when desmond turned the failsafe key and what was the deal with the scientists in the arctic searching for electromagnetic annamolies.
